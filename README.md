## Restaurant Management Website - MERN Stack

This project is a full-stack restaurant management website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It caters to both customers and restaurant staff, aiming to enhance the overall dining experience.

**Live Site URL:** [https://wandering-fork.netlify.app]

### Features

**For Customers:**

* **Browse Menus:** Explore the complete list of delicious food items with ease.
* **Detailed Dish View:** Get detailed information about each dish, including descriptions and ingredients. (Optional: Photos)
* **Seamless Ordering (Future Implementation):** This website lays the foundation for a future online ordering system, offering a convenient way to place orders directly through the website.

**For Restaurant Staff:**

* **Inventory Management:** Effortlessly add, modify, or delete menu items, keeping the online menu up-to-date with real-time changes.
* **Streamlined Operations:** Manage the restaurant's online presence with a user-friendly platform that simplifies menu updates and internal workflows. 

### Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **UI Component Libraries:** DaisyUI or Material Tailwind (Choose one)
* **Authentication (Future Implementation):** Firebase Authentication for secure user access and management (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakhawatHossen-coder/wonder-fork-restaurant.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd restaurant-management-website
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Set up Firebase Authentication (if implemented)

* Create a Firebase project and configure authentication methods.
* Update the application configuration with your Firebase project credentials.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000/.

### Usage

**Customers:**

* Users can freely browse the menu, view detailed information about each dish, and (in the future) place online orders directly through the website.

**Restaurant Staff:**

* Staff can access a dedicated section (requires authentication if implemented) to manage the menu. This includes adding new dishes, modifying existing ones, and deleting items from the menu. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the customer-facing side of the website.
